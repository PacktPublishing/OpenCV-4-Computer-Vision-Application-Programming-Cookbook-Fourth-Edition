**Build complex computer vision applications with OpenCV and C++**

## What is this book about?
OpenCV is an image and video processing library used for all types of image and video analysis. Throughout the book, you'll work through recipes that implement a variety of tasks, such as facial recognition and detection. With 70 self-contained tutorials, this book examines common pain points and best practices for computer vision (CV) developers. Each recipe addresses a specific problem and offers a proven, best-practice solution with insights into how it works, so that you can copy the code and configuration files and modify them to suit your needs.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Install and create a program using the OpenCV library 
* Segment images into homogenous regions and extract meaningful objects 
* Apply image filters to enhance image content 
* Exploit image geometry to relay different views of a pictured scene 
* Calibrate the camera from different image observations 
Detect people and objects in images using machine learning techniques 
Reconstruct a 3D scene from images 
Explore face detection using deep learning

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
// compute distance from target color
if (getDistanceToTargetColor(*it)<=maxDist) {
     *itout= 255;

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you’re a CV developer or professional who already uses or would like to use OpenCV for building computer vision software, this book is for you. You’ll also find this book useful if you’re a C++ programmer looking to extend your computer vision skillset by learning OpenCV.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).

## Get to Know the Author
**David Millán Escrivá**
was 8 years old when he wrote his first program on an 8086 PC in Basic, which enabled the 2D plotting of basic equations. In 2005, he finished his studies in IT with honors, through the Universitat Politécnica de Valencia, in human-computer interaction supported by computer vision with OpenCV (v0.96). He has worked with Blender, an open source, 3D software project, and on its first commercial movie, Plumiferos, as a computer graphics software developer. David has more than 10 years' experience in IT, with experience in computer vision, computer graphics, pattern recognition, and machine learning, working on different projects, and at different start-ups, and companies. He currently works as a researcher in computer vision.

**Robert Laganiere**
is a professor at the University of Ottawa, Canada. He is also a faculty member of the VIVA research lab and is the coauthor of several scientific publications and patents in content-based video analysis, visual surveillance, driver-assistance, object detection, and tracking. He cofounded Visual Cortek, a video analytics start-up, which was later acquired by iWatchLife. He is also a consultant in computer vision and has assumed the role of chief scientist in a number of start-ups companies, including Cognivue Corp, iWatchLife, and Tempo Analytics. Robert has a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree from Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal (1987), and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from INRS-Telecommunications, Montreal (1996).
